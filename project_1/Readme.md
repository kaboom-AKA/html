# Classification_of_Animals_Webpage

This is a simple HTML webpage that provides information on five classifications of animals: **birds**, **fish**, **mammals**, **reptiles**, and **amphibians**. The page includes a brief description, an image, and a link to more information for each classification.

## Features

  - **Birds**: Warm-blooded animals with feathers, beaks, and the ability to lay eggs.
  - **Fish**: Cold-blooded aquatic vertebrates with gills and scales.
  - **Mammals**: Warm-blooded animals that nurse their young and have hair or fur.
  - **Reptiles**: Cold-blooded, scaly animals often found in dry environments.
  - **Amphibians**: Cold-blooded animals that live both in water and on land.
  
- **Clickable Links**: Each section has a link to a Wikipedia page for further reading.
- **Images**: Each classification has a relevant image to help visualize the animal group.
- **Responsive Design**: The page adapts to different screen sizes for easy readability.
